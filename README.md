# Expressive Animator Crack

There are three methods you can use:
- [Method 1: WCP (Web Cache Poisoning)](#method-1-wcp-web-cache-poisoning)
- [Method 2: Userscript](#method-2-userscript)
- [Method 3: Website](#method-3-website)

## Method 1: WCP (Web Cache Poisoning)
### Instructions
1. Copy the code from the [WCP script]()
2. Open DevTools (`Ctrl + Shift + I` or `Cmd + Option + I`) on Expressive Animator
3. Navigate to the Console tab
4. Paste the code and run

> NOTE: Pasting in the console is by default not allowed. If you cannot paste, type out "allow pasting" in the console and press Enter.


### Pros

- No other tools are needed

### Cons

- DevTools required

## Method 2: Userscript

### Cons
- No website cache for faster loading
- Userscript manager required
